To add support for TOML to an existing project, you should add the Micronaut TOML module to your build configuration. For example:

dependency:toml[groupId="io.micronaut.toml"]

You can then start using TOML for your application configuration:

.Minimal application.toml
[source,toml]
----
[micronaut.application]
name = "example"
----
